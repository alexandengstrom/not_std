### Reinventing the standard library

This is a project I started to learn more about data structures. My goal is to implement the common data structures from scratch as a learning project. Additionally, creating them on my own allows me the flexibility to easily modify them when I need a specific change for a particular task.

### Implemented data structures:

- [x] vector
- [x] unordered_map
- [x] pair
- [ ] string
- [ ] queue
- [ ] list
- [ ] set
- [ ] priority_queue
- [ ] stack
